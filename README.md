## How to run..? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
#### 01. Open the Script in Google Colab : [![Colab for images](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ravindu644/Scamsung/blob/Samsung/Scamsung.ipynb)
#### 02. Press all the play buttons (‚ñ∂Ô∏è).
#### 03. The script will ask you a firmware link. You must put a direct link for the full firmware package. I prefer samfw.com for this.
- Open samfw.com.
- Type your model number > choose your current region (CSC).
- Go to your phone's setitngs > about phone > software information > find the last digits of your build number.

- Find the exact firmware version, which matches with your build number.
- Click "Download on Samfw server" > once download started, cancel it and go to the download page by pressing "ctrl + j".
- Right click on the cancelled firmware file and choose "copy link"
- Then give the link to the script.  
#### 04. Once my script downloaded the firmware of your device, it will ask for "What you want to do..?" like this:
